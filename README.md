# Hyperspeed SDXL with Latent Consistency models

## Overview

Hyperspeed-SDXL is a Python script that harnesses the power of the Latent Consistency models for rapid text-to-image generation. This script leverages the Latent Consistency models to achieve astonishingly fast image generation times. On a benchmark GPU, such as the RTX 3060 Ti, image generation takes just under 1 second, with even faster results on higher-end GPUs. With Hyperspeed-SDXL, you can seamlessly transform text prompts into high-quality 1024x1024 images in just a second!

```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd hyperspeed-sdxl
```
3. Install the required dependencies using pip and the provided requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script using the following command:
